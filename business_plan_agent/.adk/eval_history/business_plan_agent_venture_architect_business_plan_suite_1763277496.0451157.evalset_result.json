Executive Summary\\n\\nPawsitive Steps Pet Care is a proposed local dog-walking and pet-sitting service established in Toronto, Ontario. Addressing the escalating demand for reliable, professional, and compassionate pet care, Pawsitive Steps will offer a comprehensive suite of services including scheduled dog walks, in-home pet sitting for various animals, puppy visits, and specialized care. The Canadian pet care market is experiencing robust growth, with a significant \\\"humanization of pets\\\" trend driving demand for premium and personalized services. The pet services market in Canada is projected to reach USD 1,519.0 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.9% from 2024. Toronto, with its high density of pet-owning households\u2014estimated at 410,000 households with dogs in 2024\u2014presents a fertile ground for a high-quality, customer-centric pet care provider.\\n\\nPawsitive Steps will differentiate itself through highly personalized service, advanced digital integration for seamless client communication (including GPS-tracked walks and photo updates), certified and insured pet care professionals, and a strong community focus. Our mission is to provide unparalleled peace of mind to pet owners by ensuring their beloved companions receive the highest standard of care, exercise, and affection in their absence. We project achieving profitability within the first year, driven by a tiered pricing model, recurring service packages, and strategic marketing efforts targeting affluent, busy professionals and families in key Toronto neighbourhoods. This plan outlines the market opportunity, our strategic approach, operational framework, and financial projections for Pawsitive Steps Pet Care.\\n\\n## 2. Problem & Opportunity\\n\\n### 2.1. The Modern Pet Owner's Dilemma\\nIn the fast-paced urban environment of Toronto, pet owners, particularly busy professionals, families, and seniors, frequently face challenges in consistently meeting their pets' needs for exercise, companionship, and care. Long working hours, unpredictable schedules, business travel, vacations, and even health issues can prevent owners from providing the attention and routine their pets require. This often leads to stress for both the pets (exhibiting anxiety, destructive behaviour due to lack of stimulation) and their owners (guilt, logistical difficulties). The problem is multifaceted:\\n\\n*   **Time Constraints:** Many Toronto residents commute long hours or work demanding jobs, leaving insufficient time for daily dog walks or midday pet checks.\\n*   **Travel & Absences:** Vacation, business trips, or emergencies necessitate reliable and trustworthy pet care alternatives to boarding kennels, which can be stressful for pets.\\n*   **Specialized Needs:** Puppies require frequent visits, senior pets may need medication, and some animals thrive better in their familiar home environment rather than a kennel.\\n*   **Trust & Reliability:** Pet owners seek highly vetted, professional, and insured caregivers they can implicitly trust with their pets and their homes.\\n*   **Convenience & Communication:** The demand for easy booking, flexible scheduling, and real-time updates on their pet's well-being is growing.\\n\\n### 2.2. The Growing Pet Care Market Opportunity\\nThe pet industry in Canada, including services, is experiencing significant growth, fueled by several key trends. Approximately 65% of Canadian households own at least one pet, with the total pet population expected to reach 28.51 million by 2025. Dogs alone accounted for 7.9 million in 2022. The \\\"humanization of pets\\\" trend is paramount, where pets are increasingly considered integral family members, leading owners to prioritize their well-being and invest in premium services.\\n\\nThe Canadian pet services market generated revenues of USD 782.2 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 1,519.0 million by 2030, with a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2024. Notably, \\\"sitting\\\" is identified as the fastest-growing service type within this market. In Toronto specifically, an estimated 410,000 households own dogs, demonstrating a vast potential client base. This market is further concentrated in higher-income areas along the lakeshore and north along Yonge Street, where residents are likely to have disposable income for premium pet services.\\n\\nThe opportunity for Pawsitive Steps Pet Care lies in capitalizing on this growing, affluent, and emotionally invested market segment in Toronto by offering a superior, transparent, and trustworthy pet care solution that addresses the specific pain points of modern pet ownership.\\n\\n## 3.
